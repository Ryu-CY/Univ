Modify the tutorial codes and implement the following functions,

1. Display 3D models loaded from external files. (4 pt)
	1.1 Add an OBJ parser to the framework that loads a 3D model directly from an OBJ file.
	(Do NOT use the TXT files.)
	1.2 Search and display three 3D models at the same time.
	(Do NOT use simple primitives such as cube, cylinder, pyramid, etc.)
	1.3 Use a different texture for each model.
	1.4 Rotate each model continuously against the up axis (y-axis).

2 Display a ground plane. (2 pt)
	2.1 Use a plane that covers an entire ground and shows the horizon.
	2.2 Apply a texture with patterns to the plane.

3 Display different filtering effects using the keyboard inputs. (4 pt)
	3.1 “1”: the point filter mode (D3D11_FILTER_MIN_MAG_MIP_POINT)
	3.2 “2”: the linear filter mode (D3D11_FILTER_MIN_MAG_MIP_LINEAR)
	3.3 “3”: the anisotropic filter mode (D3D11_FILTER_ANISOTROPIC)
	3.4 The visual difference between each filter mode should be clearly displayed.
